# chord-finder
A simple Java program from a couple of years ago that solves basic music theory exercises via the command line.

One of my first personal coding projects; written with a focus on foundational Java syntax.


INITIAL VERSION: runs using a command line menu, with scale degrees 1-7 & notes `[a-g](#|b)?` marking notes/accidentals. 


FUTURE EDITS: proper error handling, code readability & organization, proper ui
